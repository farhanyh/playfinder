    "description": "You channel positive energy to heal the living or damage the undead. If the target is a willing living creature, you restore 1d8 Hit Points. If the target is undead, you deal that amount of positive damage to it, and it gets a basic Fortitude save. The number of actions you spend when (activity: Casting this Spell | Cast a Spell) determines its targets, range, area, and other parameters.\n~ ONE-ACTION (somatic): The spell has a range of touch.\n~ TWO-ACTIONS (verbal, somatic): The spell has a range of 30 feet. If you’re healing a living creature, increase the Hit Points restored by 8.\n~ THREE-ACTIONS (material, somatic, verbal): You disperse positive energy in a 30-foot emanation. This targets all living and undead creatures in the burst.",
