    "description": "Either one of your parents was an elf, or one or both were half-elves. You have pointed ears and other telltale signs of elf heritage. You gain the (trait: elf) trait and low-light vision. In addition, you can select elf and half-elf feats whenever you gain an ancestry feat.\nBy default, half-elves descend from humans, but your GM might allow you to be the offspring of an elf and a different ancestry. In these cases, the GM will let you select the half-elf heritage as the heritage for this other ancestry. The most likely other parent of a half-elf are gnomes and halflings.",
